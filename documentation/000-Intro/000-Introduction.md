# Introduction

I'll start this documentation with a brief warning. PHP isn't great for this sort of stuff. Reading and writing
low-level binary data is much more the domain of something like C or Java, where types actually mean something.

*However*, sometimes it can be convenient to do everything in-house, so to speak. That's why I wrote php-binary.

*By the way, this documentation site is powered by [Veto](https://github.com/themainframe/veto), my silly little framework.*
