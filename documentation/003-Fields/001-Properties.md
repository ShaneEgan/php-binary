## Properties

Fields may have properties associated with them.

A typical property of a field may be the length (size) - the number of bytes that the field spans within the stream.

Properties are set using setters on the field object. When using the `SchemaBuilder`, properties are obtained and set
automatically from the associative array corresponding to each field.
